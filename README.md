# Skeychain
Simple Wrapper for Keychain

## Example

Create a class that extend from SKeychain and define the data to be protected.

```swift

class KeychainWrapper: SKeychain {

    // The user's password (stored in the keychain and protected).    
    
    static var password: String? {
        get {
            let value = load(with: "password", prompt: "Autenticarse para iniciar sesi√≥n.")
            return value
        }
        set {
            if let newValue = newValue {
                save(with: "password", data: newValue)
            } else {
                delete(with: "password")
            }
        }
    }
}

```

Set the new password

```swift
KeychainWrapper.password = "$up3r$3cr3t"
```
